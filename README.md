# Levante Tacos

This project is just a little sandbox that I set up with my dad so that we could help each other learn new technologies and old standards.

## The problem

My dad's new favorite restaurant is on wheels. The Levante taco truck operates primarily in Lee's Summit. Their menu is simple and their food is delicious. Unfortunately, their website doesn't match the quality of their offerings.

## The solution

With our powers combined, my dad and I are hoping we can help Levante out by creating a sleek, mobile-friendly, easy-to-use app that not only features online ordering and payments, but would also allow them to track inventory, manage social media posts, handle scheduling, live update the truck's location, and more.

## Tech stack

We're going to use React, Node.js, Express, and GraphQL with Appolo. I guess you would call that a GERN stack. For styling, we'll be using SASS with a couple Material Design components peppered in. The menu and ordering is all going to be handled through the Square API. The taco truck location finder will be handled with the Google Maps API.

## Down the line

Eventually, we hope to move all styling, labels, names, and anything else unique to Levante to be stored in the database. Then we will be able to sell our template to other food trucks.
